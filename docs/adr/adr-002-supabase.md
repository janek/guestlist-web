- decided to use Supabase because it made for a quick start and nice DX
- occasionally thinking about lock-in (supposedly hard to self-host?)
- wondering if should use Drizzle ORM to be more independent / have ease of migration
- currently using Supabase features fairly heavily, like their client library, their realtime thing etc.
- seems like until it's clear where the project is going it doesn't make sense to put effort into making it easier to get off supabase
- but ideally don't make it harder 
- using Database Functions, which doesn't always feel right


### Supabase-specific setup
- no traditional backend, database is the backend
- realtime

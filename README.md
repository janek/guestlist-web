### Database functions
We sometimes use database functions. See more at https://chatgpt.com/share/687d0ccb-4bd0-800b-9707-8924561784b1. To define a new one, we usually generate SQL locally, save it in the repo, then paste into SQL editor in Supabase (https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/kevvsvanbzthbdnnbzth/sql/) and verify in Database Functions: (https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/kevvsvanbzthbdnnbzth/database/functions)
